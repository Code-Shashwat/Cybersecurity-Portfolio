# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi! I’m **Shashwat Buradkar**, currently learning cybersecurity through structured hands-on labs, investigation simulations, tool practice, and small automation projects.

This repository is my **learning portfolio**, where I document what I study and practice across:

- 🔵 Defensive Security (SOC / Incident Response fundamentals)
- 🔴 Offensive Security (Red Team fundamentals — future)
- ⚙️ Security Automation (Python / PowerShell)

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

### Short-Term (0–2 months)
- Understanding Fundamentals of cybersecurity
  (SOC Analyst / Security Analyst / Junior Cybersecurity role)

### Long-Term (6–12 months)
- Build strong incident investigation and response skills  
- Progress toward an Incident Responder / DFIR career path

### Future Learning
- Expand into offensive security fundamentals to strengthen overall security knowledge
