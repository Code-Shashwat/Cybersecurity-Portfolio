# Metasploit

## What it is 
- Metasploit is an exploitation framework used for vulnerability validation and penetration testing. It supports multiple phases of an assessment, including scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation.

## Why it matters in Cybersecurity 
- Helps validate whether a vulnerability is truly exploitable
- Useful for penetration testing, security assessments, and controlled lab simulations
  
## What i practiced
- Using msfconsole
- Setting up and using the Metasploit database
- Vulnerability scanning and enumeration
- Exploitation of vulnerable services in lab environments
- Understanding Meterpreter sessions and post-exploitation basics


## Quick References
- `msfconsole commands: ls,history,use,show options,show paylods,back,info,search`
- `Initialize Db : sudo -u postgres msfdb init`
- `Interact with sessions : session -i <session id>`
- `Meterpreter examples: hashdump,search`


## Key Takeaways
- Patching and timely remediation are critical, because known vulnerabilities can be exploited quickly using frameworks like Metasploit
