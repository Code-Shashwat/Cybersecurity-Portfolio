# Wireshark

## What it is 
Wireshark is packet analyser tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP).

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
- Helps validate suspicious network activity
- Useful for investigating DNS, HTTP, and TLS traffic
- Supports malware/phishing investigations

## What I practiced
- Analyse Packets 
- Filtering traffic by IP and protocol
- Inspecting DNS queries and HTTP requests
- Identifying suspicious domains and connections

## Quick Reference
- `dns`
- `http`
- `tls`
- `ip.addr == x.x.x.x`
- `tcp.port == 443`

## Key Takeaways
- Filtering is more important than reading every packet
- DNS analysis is often the first step in investigations
