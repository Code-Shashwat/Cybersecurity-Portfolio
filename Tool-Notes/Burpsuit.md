- Widely used for web and mobile application security testing
- Helps identify vulnerabilities such as authentication issues, input validation flaws, and insecure configurations

## What i practiced
- Configuring browser traffic to route through the Burp proxy
- Using Site Map to explore and understand application structure
- Defining scope and targeting specific applications for testing

## Quick References
- Proxy setup: Configure browser proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080
- Common tools: Proxy, Repeater, Intruder, Target, Site Map

## Key Takeaways
- Intercepting HTTP/HTTPS traffic is essential for understanding how web applications handle requests, authentication, and user input
- HTTPS encryption protects data in transit, but security issues can still exist at the application level
